im finding this series of interrelated scripts to be too disjointed and getting too complex to manage properly. both archetecturally and in terms of how they interact, how they share data and processes data, and also in term of the ux and what features even exist. 

also the folder structure is feeling really messy and it's hard to see the forest for the trees. 

some ideas
- let's do some cleanup of the folder structure.
- please generate a new README.md with updated information.
- create a mermaid flowchart explaining how all the scripts interact and process data from the beginning intake of cover letters to the cover letter reports. 
- let's do some naming cleanup. the core scripts and json files should be named more clearly and also the idea of 'sentences' being a core compontent isnt really true anymore as mostly we have sentence groups. so suggest something more accurate please.
